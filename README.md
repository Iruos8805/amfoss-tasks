# SELF INTRO 

I am SOURI S from Aluva,Ernakulam currently pursuing CSE AI. I like to test myself with challenges that demand atmost dedication, patience and thinking from me. I strongly believe that challenges,tasks and obstacles act as a sieve that will help in draining crisp and perfect results from a person. I yearn for anything and everything that will provide me with valuable exposure and connections filling me with experience and knowledge needed to improve myself in whatever field it may be. I am always curious and that I believe, helps me to dive deep searching for answers to visualise enthralling future for technology. I strongly believe that my skills of oratory, writing and directing can also be resonated into other forms in this field.

# WHY MUST YOU CHOOSE ME?
I have set some goals for the next 4 years and beyond and I know this club can play a vital role in achieving them. I have always believed that the key to success is 3D or Dedication, Determination and Discipline. I am always curious and never give up on something. I can assure atmost dedication and hardwork on achieveing and completing my tasks. I have no block in asking questions and I beleive thus it helps me to clear all my doubts to produce a better,clear and crisp output. I always thinks about the future,past and present of anything and everything I see. I always think about how a particular thing or object can develop in the future, how much it has changed from its past and thus how much we have been able to achieve. I stronlgy believe this club will help me in answering a lot of doubts and mould me to be a person who can interpret things differently to give useful and innovate products.  amFOSS, I believe is the best place I can use my curiosity and hardwork in the most useful way and I strongly believe the club will benefit from it too. 

# MY GOALS FOR NEXT 6 MONTHS AND HOW I PLAN ON ACCOMPLISHING THEM
My goals for next 6 months is to try and do anything and everything to be able to contribute back to this field, to learn more and more about all the possibilities and opportunities the field offers. Not just hearing stuff and making notes of it, but instead to try and understand it. To try and understand what particularly excites me in this vast field, so that I can build on it. To become independent, so that I don't have to depend on tutorials for writing my code and developing things. To participate in as many events, hackathons, projects and programs to ensure my skillsets are something I can be proud of. Overall, my ultimate aim is to grow. To ensure that I grow with this ever growing field and instead is not left behind. I dislike to be a alien to the field that I hope to a part of.

# HOW I PLAN ON CONTRIBUTING BACK TO THE CLUB
I strongly trust that if one is a part of something like a group,a society, a club etc, it is that person's duty to help the club to reach new heights, venture into unknown yet knowledge filled lands that haven't been explored before, to help the club grow more than ever before by achieving stellar achievements individually and at the same time helping others of the club to do the same. Yes, the club is already famous and known for their striking achivements, but I strongly believe that there is always more and more to do. Dedication to the club and for its members are the things I can promise that I can contribute back to the club. 
"Alone we can do so little, Together we can do so much". Thus by working on myself and also helping all members in my club to improve on themselves and in the future helping the next set of people to find their spark, I can assure the club will quickly rise to its ever rising potential. I also believe that I will also be able to find new areas in the field to work, develop and research and thus increasing the pallette of areas the club can offer.

# PRAVESHAN PROCESS FEEDBACK
There is nothing to complain about PRAVESHAN. I felt that everything was organised and done in a very systematic way, that too perfectly. The members of the group (seniors) were very supportive and was there to clear any genuine doubts. They were also very motivating. The whole process I felt was a training to what it looks like inside the club. The only suggestion I can offer is to provide a little more direct source material to help one with the tasks.
