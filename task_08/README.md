# Poke-Search!

This was the most difficult task I did (if one don't consider spending about 2 weeks on GeoQuest). Firstly, I was not able to run the python file due to the lack of a plugin in Ubuntu. A member
of  amFOSS guided me out of the issue. I use a Jio connection and thus I was not able to view the pokemon image even after calling the API. I also did a lot of mistakes (foolish and bad ones).
Anyhow, I was able to pull it off in the end and I once again learnedd the lesson that making mistakes is a part of learning and there is nothing foolish about it.
