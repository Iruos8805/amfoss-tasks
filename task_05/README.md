This task was fun to do. I got to finally experince what goes behindcreating a website and moreover designing and styling it. I id hit frustrating obstacles, yet I completed it. I have used links from the github repository as image and icon url, but due to some issues I can't view them once I switched to Jio. Other than that this was a fun experince with a lot of realisation. Youtube and some websites from Google were my source of help here.
