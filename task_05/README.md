This task was fun to do. I got to finally experince what goes behind creating a website and moreover designing and styling it. I did hit frustrating obstacles, yet I completed it. I have used links from the github repository as image and icon url.This was a fun experince with a lot of realisation. Youtube and some websites from Google were my source of help here.
