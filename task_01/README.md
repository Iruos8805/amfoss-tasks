# Terminal Wizard

I enjoyed this task a lot. The Harry Potter theme was what interested me a lot. The task was an easy one as I already knew the basiclinuxcommands. Pushing the folder to Github repository was 
a task I gound difficult. Nonenthless now I know it clearly.

I pushed the earlier parts of the code to the 'main' branch, and I think  traces of it can be found in the commit log.
