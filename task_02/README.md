I was able to design my website and launch it successfully in Github Pages. Due to some error or issue the style or theme was however not applied to the website pages. 
I was able to fix the issue for the main page, however I was not able to do the same for the ABOUT and BLOG page.
For this task, the examplecode that was given in the HUGO website was my helping hand to partially complete this task
