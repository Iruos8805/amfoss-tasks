This was once again a great learning experience. As a person with no coding background, this helped me a lot to get to know different languages and alsoto check and find their subtle similarities. Youtube and Google proved me my greatest assests in this task as I approached them to complete this taks. I could only get 7 completed as I found the rest very difficult to do despite trying for couple of days.
