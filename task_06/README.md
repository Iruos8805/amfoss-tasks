This was one of the most difficult tasks for me. The foundation for making the discord bot and all went nice, but I struggled a lot with scraping the web for information. It took me about 4 days to comlete the task. Youtube and Google were once again my souce of help. I was very happy to have it completed and I understood that if determined making a discord bot is not a difficult task.
